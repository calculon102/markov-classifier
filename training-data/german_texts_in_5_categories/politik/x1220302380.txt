Smack That Cheney-Bot!
Vice President Dick Cheney keeps repeating the nonsensical claims about the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda as if he has a microchip malfunction.
The whole thing was extremely suspicious.
People here still haven't stopped buzzing about the president's bizarre behavior at the White House unveiling ceremony for the Clintons' official portraits on Monday.
Mr. Bush acted totally out of character: witty, engaged, amiable, bipartisan and magnanimous.
Even to Bill and Hillary.
W. gave lavish encomiums - and even a nickname - to the man he once accused of stripping the White House of dignity and honor.
Even Bill Clinton was dumbfounded, not to mention confounded.
Shouldn't he have felt like the ham and cheese between two slices of Wonder bread?
Mr. Clinton told friends afterward that he was blown away, that W. had never been so nice to him before.
There was no smirk, no begrudging.
And Clinton pals at a Georgetown restaurant that night alternated between bellowing about getting rid of President Bush and marveling at how great he'd been at the unveiling.
Mr. Clinton used to study Reagan tapes to pick up pointers; why shouldn't Mr. Bush?
Perhaps we have a Potomac invasion of the body snatchers.
All world domination, all the time, can be wearing.
The Republicans messed up their first attempt at this, when they took Dick Cheney to an undisclosed location to switch him with a replicant.
Mr. Cheney did it again on Monday in Florida speaking at - where else?
But aside from sending an official to meet with Osama in Sudan, Saddam stiffed his request for weapons and training-camp space.
Mr. Cheney isn't programmed to process evidence that shows he was wrong; he simply keeps repeating the same nonsensical claims as if he has a microchip malfunction.
He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda-a-a.
