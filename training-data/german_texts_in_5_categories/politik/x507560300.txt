The president's interview on NBC revealed a leader consistent in only one thing: his sense of self-justification.
When Americans choose a president, their most profound consideration is whether a candidate can make the wisest possible decisions when it comes to war.
In the case of George W. Bush, they will not only judge whether the invasion of Iraq was the right decision, but what our president has brought away from that experience.
If there were misjudgments about the nature of Iraq's weapons programs or in the ways the administration presented that intelligence to the public, we need to know whether he recognizes them and has learned from them.
Yesterday, in an interview with NBC's Tim Russert, after a week in which it became obvious to most Americans that the justifications for the war were based on flawed intelligence, Mr. Bush offered his reflections, and they were far from reassuring.
The only clarity in the president's vision appears to be his own perfect sense of self-justification.
Right now, the questions average Americans are asking about Iraq seem much clearer than the ones Mr. Bush is willing to confront.
People want to know why American intelligence was so wrong about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
Mr. Bush didn't have a consistent position on this pivotal issue.
At other moments he suggested the weapons might still be hidden somewhere, or that they may have been transported to another country.
At times he depicted himself as having been misled by intelligence reports.
But he insisted that George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, was doing a good job and deserved to keep his job.
Average Americans are also asking themselves whether invading Iraq would have seemed like the right decision if we knew then what we know now.
Mr. Bush doesn't seem willing to even take on this critical question.
He repeatedly referred to Saddam Hussein as a dangerous madman, without defining the threat that even a madman, without any weapons of mass destruction, posed to the United States.
At one point, his reasoning seemed to be that even if the dictator did not have the feared weapons, he could have started manufacturing them on a moment's notice.
In fact, Mr. Kay said that Iraq's weapons program seemed to have ground to a halt under the pressure of the United Nations inspections and sanctions that Mr. Bush and his staff disdained last year.
Mr. Kay said Saddam Hussein retained only the basic ability to restart weapons programs if that pressure were removed.
At other times, the president seemed to argue that the invasion was necessary simply to demonstrate that Americans did not back down from a fight.
And it's very hard to take seriously Mr. Bush's contention that he was not surprised by the intensity of the resistance in Iraq.
The president was doing far more yesterday than rolling out the administration's spin for the next campaign.
He was demonstrating how he is likely to think if confronted with a similar crisis in the future.
The fuzziness and inconsistency of his comments suggest he is still relying on his own moral absolutism, that in a dangerous world the critical thing is to act decisively, and worry about connecting the dots later.
Mr. Bush said repeatedly that he went to the United Nations seeking a diplomatic alternative to war.
In fact, the United States rejected all diplomatic alternatives at the time, severely damaging relations with some of its most important and loyal allies.
Some of Mr. Bush's comments yesterday raise questions even more disturbing than the idea that senior administration members might have misled the nation about the intelligence on Iraq.
The nation obviously needs a leader who is always alert to the threat of terrorism from abroad.
But it cannot afford to have one who responds to the trauma of 9/11 by overreacting to the possibility of danger.
Nothing in the interview offered much hope in that direction.
