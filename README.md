# markov-classifier

This software was developed for my master-thesis during the second half of 2015. It's purpose is to train hidden-markov-models according to the algorithms developed within the thesis. These trained model may then be used to analyze and automatically classifiy given text-files. As emissions for the markov-model, significant cooccurrences where used. Additionally a second method of classification was implemented: the statistical usage of recurring word-orders.

Beside the academic aspect, this project was used by me to learn and practice JavaFX-technology.
